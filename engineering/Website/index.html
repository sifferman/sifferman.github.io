<h1>Motivation</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        In summer 2020, I had just finished my most intense quarter yet (23 units) and COVID was forcing everyone indoors, so naturally I needed a large project to keep busy while maintaining my momentum from school. Thus, <a href="https://ethan.sifferman.dev">ethan.sifferman.dev</a> was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website stores a collection of my personal projects in recent years. I don&rsquo;t always have time to keep it updated, but it was a fun summer project to keep my mind off the apocalypse.

<h1>Interactive Headers</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        This is a collision-less gravity simulator. Try changing the parameters around!
    </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
        This is my favorite header of the two. It is a music player of a song that I never finished writing. I recorded all the parts myself! (except for the Bass Clarinet MIDI)
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent a lot of time trying to improve performance with negative-feedback-loops so that all instruments would synchronize. However, mobile performance still kinda sucks...
